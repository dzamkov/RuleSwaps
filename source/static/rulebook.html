						<h1>Rules</h1>
						<p>
							RuleSwaps is a game where you create new rules as you play and compete
							to shift the rules in your favor.
							The core of RuleSwaps is a deck of cards where each card contains a fragment
							of an instruction.
							These cards can be assembled to build actions that are played out in the game.
							In RuleSwaps, every action taken, and every choice made, is written somewhere
							on a card.
						</p>
						<h2>Building Actions</h2>
						<p>
							There are three type of cards in RuleSwaps: <span class="action">Action</span>,
							<span class="condition">Condition</span> and <span class="player">Player</span>.
							To build an action, you'll need to start with an <span class="action">Action</span> card.
							Sometimes, that's all you'll need, but in most cases, your card will have "slots"
							that need to be filled in using other cards. Slots appear as colored, parenthesized
							text. Read through your card. If you hit a slot, you'll need to place down another
							card whose type matches the slot. Then continue by reading through <em>that</em>
							card, again filling in slots as you go. Repeat the process until you've read through
							all the cards and filled in all the slots. You should end up with one long sentence
							that tells you what the action does.
						</p>
						<div class="center-container">
							<div class="rulebook-subsection">
								<div class="card-list" data-cards="conditional_player_loses_coins you_pay wealthiest_player"></div>
								<p class="subtitle"><b>Example: </b>This action would be read as "If (You pay 20 coins), (Wealthiest player) loses 30 coins"</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							To "perform" an action, you would just follow the combined instructions from the cards.
						</p>
						<h2>The Constitution</h2>
						<p>
							So what do you actually do on your turn? That's entirely determined by a set of cards
							known as <em>The Constitution</em>. These are set up at the start of the game, and
							may be altered during play. The Constitution is made up of actions, called <em>Amendments</em>.
							Every round, each player will go through the amendments, in order, and perform
							the actions they describe (i.e. "invoking" the amendment). The standard unmodified
							constitution is as follows:
						</p>
						<div class="center-container">
							<div class="rulebook-subsection">
								<div class="constitution"></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							Note that some of the amendments allow you to perform an action or propose an
							amendment. When you invoke these amendments, that's your chance to build actions of
							and apply them to the game.
						</p>
						<h2>Setup</h2>
						<p>
							To start the game, all players get 20 coins. One player is chosen to go first and draws
							4 cards. The next player going clockwise draws 5 cards and every subsequent player
							draws 6 cards. Afterwards, the game begins. Each player, starting with the first and
							going clockwise, invokes the amendments of constitution in the order they appear. This
							continues until a player wins.
						</p>
						<h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
						<p>
							The primary way of winning is to simply perform an action that says you win.
							This usually requires you to satisfy some conditions first. For example, the standard
							constitution has this action as an amendment:
						</p>
						<div class="center-container">
							<div class="rulebook-subsection">
								<div class="card-list" data-cards="wealth_win"></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							If you have 100 coins at the time you perform this action, you win and the game ends.
							Besides cards, there is one other way to win the game: if anyone draws the last card
							from the deck, that player wins and the game ends immediately.
						</p>
						<h2>Clarifications</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If a card tells you to "perform an action", that means you build an action using
								cards from your hand and then perform that action. Afterwards, discard the cards
								used in the action.
							</li>
							<li>
								If a card tells you to "propose an amendment", that means you build an action using
								cards from your hand and also specify a place in constitution where those cards
								would go. If the amendment is "ratified", those cards become a permanent addition
								to the constitution. Otherwise, the cards are discarded.
							</li>
							<li>
								Whenever a player needs to discard, it is their choice which cards to discard.
